## Basic ML contents
1. Hypothesis<br>
-> this is what we expect, means that we expect graph will be... and also we don't know real one yet.

2. cost function<br>
-> this is difference between H(x) and Real(X), we have to decreasse this difference

3. gradient descent<br>
-> 1,2 is in the case of linear regression, we can make shape of cost function and gradient descent algorithm can find the optimizing position by diffenretiating postion and moving left and right.
